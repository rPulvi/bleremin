A node module for Max to read data from BLE devices.

This example shows how to connect via bluetooth with a ble device inside the Max environment.
Once connected the values from the accelerometer are used to drive a signal generator.

The board used for this example is the STEVAL-IDB008V2 from STMicroelectronics (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-idb008v2.html)
